Latest version (1.0) was released on 20/01/2019.
> Windows: http://decino.nl/files/pfx/pfx_v1.0.zip

-----
##### How to Play
Unzip the downloaded file to your Quake II directory.

Windows users can click the batch file to start up the game with the modified client and mod loaded. Non-Windows users must compile the binaries first, execute the modified client, and then type "game pfx" followed by "map q2dm1" (or whatever map you enjoy). The in-game menu is pretty self-explanatory, move the cursor with the [ and ] keys, select with enter and open/close with tab.

You MUST use the modified client to render some of the unused particle effects! The game will disconnect you if you don't.
